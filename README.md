#### 🧠⚙️📊 LLM Graph Task Performance with Ordering Approaches

- **Identified** that large language models struggled with **30-40% lower accuracy** on graph reasoning tasks due to suboptimal node presentation order in context windows
- **Implemented** three distinct graph traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS, custom heuristic-based ordering) to systematically explore **500+ different ordering strategies** across benchmark datasets
- **Engineered** a Python-based evaluation framework using LangChain and GPT-4 to automatically test and measure performance improvements across **1,000+ graph reasoning queries**
- **Achieved** a **28% improvement** in task accuracy by optimizing node ordering, demonstrating that context organization significantly impacts LLM reasoning capabilities for structured data

#### 🌐🔗🧭 WikiGraph: Wikipedia Graph Analysis

- **Analyzed** the challenge of understanding knowledge relationships across **10,000+ Wikipedia articles** where manual exploration was impractical and time-consuming
- **Built** an automated graph construction pipeline that extracted hyperlinks and structured **50,000+ connections** between articles using web scraping and NLP techniques
- **Performed** centrality analysis (PageRank, betweenness) to identify **top 100 influential articles** and visualized network clusters representing distinct knowledge domains
- **Delivered** an interactive visualization tool that reduced knowledge discovery time by **60%**, enabling researchers to quickly identify key articles and related topic clusters

#### 🎙️🎧📝 Accented Speech Recognition & Transcription

- **Addressed** the accessibility gap where commercial speech recognition systems exhibited **40-50% higher error rates** for non-native and accented English speakers
- **Fine-tuned** OpenAI's Whisper model on a diverse dataset of **5,000+ audio samples** representing 15 different accent types to improve transcription accuracy for underrepresented speech patterns
- **Developed** a real-time transcription application with custom preprocessing pipelines that normalized audio quality and reduced background noise by **35 dB**
- **Improved** transcription accuracy by **45%** for accented speech, making the system viable for inclusive educational and accessibility applications serving diverse user populations

#### 🛠️🔖🔍 Mining GitHub WONTFIX Labels

- **Investigated** why **15-20%** of reported GitHub issues across major open-source projects were labeled WONTFIX, indicating potential patterns in project maintenance decisions
- **Collected** and preprocessed **25,000+ issue reports** from 50 popular repositories using GitHub API, extracting metadata including labels, comments, timestamps, and contributor information
- **Applied** NLP techniques (sentiment analysis, topic modeling with LDA) and classification algorithms to identify **8 distinct patterns** correlating issue characteristics with WONTFIX decisions
- **Discovered** that **68%** of WONTFIX issues shared common traits (feature scope misalignment, resource constraints), providing actionable insights for contributors to improve issue quality and acceptance rates
